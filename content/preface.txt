The book is generated using elementary cellular automata with two contrasting elements randomly selected from a set of common literary themes. Each generation of the automaton represents a single chapter, with the individual cells representing sentences and sequences of cells with the same state representing paragraphs. Each paragraph thus flips from one theme to the next, depending on the pattern generated by the automaton.

Sentences are generated using word frequency n-grams chained from a corpus of sentences sourced from public domain fiction on Project Gutenberg. Each theme has a number of registered synonyms which are used to select a subset of potential sentences from the broader corpus. This is fairly brute force and inexact. It relies on the dubious assumption that a matching word in a sentence means that sentence relates to the theme. The diversity or uniformity of the source sentences thus has a massive impact on the quality and coherence of the resulting output.
